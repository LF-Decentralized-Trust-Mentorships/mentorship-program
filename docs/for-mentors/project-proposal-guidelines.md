Proposal Submission Template
--------------------------

Mentorship project proposal submissions to be considered for inclusion in 2026 Mentorship Program is open from February 2 to March 6, 2026. 

Mentors can [submit a mentorship project proposal](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-Mentorships/mentorship-program/issues) by creating a Mentorship Project new issue; please review the [proposal guidelines](https://lf-decentralized-trust-mentorships.github.io/mentorship-program/main/for-mentors/project-proposal-guidelines/#proposal-submission-guidelines) before submitting

Proposal Submission Guidelines
--------------------------

*   Project maintainers, active contributors and community members are welcome to submit a mentorship project proposal for consideration. Those who submit the project proposals will serve in the mentor role.
*   Multiple mentors per project is more desirable as this helps spread the mentoring workload and reduce the challenge of coverage due to working remotely with mentees from a different time zone.
*   Mentors need to be knowledgeable about the scope, goals, and technical aspects of the project and will directly guide, supervise, and evaluate the mentee's work for the duration of the mentorship.
*   The mentorship project needs to be scoped with clear objectives and outcomes, serving as a springboard to onboard a new contributor into the community.
*   The outcome envisioned for the mentorship project can be accomplished under the mentor's guidance by new contributors working ~15 hours a week for ~ 6 months.
*   The menetorship project should contribute to advancing one of the current LF Decentralized Trust Projects or Labs.

Proposal Selection Process and Criteria
--------------------------

*   A mentorship program task force appointed by the LF Decentralized Trust Technical Advisory Council will review and evaluate proposals to ensure the selected mentorship projects will benefit the LF Decentralized Trust projects or labs.
*   General selection criteria are:
    *   The selected proposals have well defined learning objectives and outcomes that could serve as a springboard to onboard new contributors.
    *   The selected proposals can be accomplished, under the guidance of the mentors, by a new developer, researcher, or contributor within established program dates.
    *   The selected proposals should have a direct connection or relevance to the goals of an existing LF Decentralized Trust Project or Lab.
    *   The selected proposals will further increase the contributor or maintainer base of the related LF Decentralized Trust Project or Lab.
    *   The selected proposals have the potential to positively impact the diverse representation of the projects, mentors, and mentees within the LF Decentralized Trust community.
*   Multiple proposals can be accepted for Projects that complete the annual review process, although we reserve the right to limit the number of mentorships per project to allow for including a wider range of projects and labs in the program.
