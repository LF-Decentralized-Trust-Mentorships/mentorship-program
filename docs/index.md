# Program Description

The LF Decentralized Trust Mentorship Program provides a structured remote learning opportunity for aspiring decentralized tech developers, researchers, and other contributors. LF Decentralized Trust project maintainers, experienced developers, and active community members will mentor participants, guiding them to complete a mentorship project with a defined scope and outcome.
