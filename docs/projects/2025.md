                ### Primary Focus

Research

### Description

**Project Scope and Objective**
This mentorship program aims to conduct a comprehensive empirical study of cross-chain bridges, focusing on security, performance, scalability, and cost of protocols. Cross-chain bridges are fundamental to blockchain interoperability, enabling seamless asset transfers between distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). However, their security vulnerabilities have led to over $2 billion in losses, highlighting the urgent need for rigorous analysis. This project seeks to empirically evaluate industry-standard bridges, both within Hyperledger technologies and public blockchains, to develop performance benchmarks and security insights.

**Problem Statement and Opportunity**
Despite existing research on blockchain interoperability, there is a lack of empirical studies comparing cross-chain bridge solutions. Previous efforts, including Hyperledger mentorships, have focused on specific implementations, but a broader industry-wide comparison remains unexplored. The increasing adoption of cross-chain bridges necessitates a standardized approach to assess their efficiency, cost, and security risks. By addressing this gap, the project will provide valuable insights for developers, enterprises, and the wider blockchain community to make informed decisions about bridge selection and improvements.

**Implementation Path**

1. Research: Identify key interoperability solutions, industry and Hyperledger-specific bridges, and establish relevant performance metrics (e.g., latency, throughput, transaction costs).

2. Test Environment Setup: Deploy multiple DLT networks, integrate cross-chain solutions, and define standardized benchmarking tests.

3. Empirical Evaluation: Conduct data collection and performance tests under different scenarios, measuring security resilience, scalability, operational efficiency, and protocol cost.

4. Analysis & Reporting: Interpret the collected data, compare solutions, and identify areas for optimization.

5. Academic Paper: Produce and publish an academic paper to share findings with the Hyperledger community and the broader blockchain ecosystem.

### Learning Objectives

- Gain hands-on experience in contributing to an open-source project, including testing, documentation, and best practices for collaborative development within the Hyperledger community
- Develop a deep understanding of cross-chain interoperability protocols
- Enhance technical writing skills by documenting findings in an academic paper, contributing to both industry and academic discussions on blockchain interoperability
- Develop research, coding, and data analysis skills by analyzing large scale datasets of cross-chain transactions


### Expected Outcome and Deliverables

A comprehensive report detailing performance comparisons of various cross-chain bridges based on latency, throughput, and cost metrics.

A reusable framework for benchmarking interoperability solutions, including scripts and configurations for setting up test environments.

Clear documentation on the benchmarking methodology, tools used, and steps to reproduce experiments, ensuring the project's long-term usability.

A research paper summarizing key findings, which may be submitted to an academic conference or industry publication to contribute to blockchain interoperability research.

Code contributions or improvements to existing Hyperledger interoperability project (Cacti), integrating benchmarking insights and recommendations.

### Relation to LF Decentralized Trust and impact on the community

[Hyperledger Cacti](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/cactus/Hyperledger+Cacti+Home) is a blockchain interoperability project. Cacti connects to several other projects: Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Besu, and others. We expect using Cacti due to its relation to the cross-chain ecosystem.

[Hyperledger Lab: Cross-Chain Bridge Aggregator](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/benchmarking-cross-chain-bridge-aggregators) is a blockchain interoperability project focused on the benchmarking of bridge aggregators. Due to its success, we are considering the usage of the already built infrastructure in a previous mentorship for this mentorship.

The integration of these projects with cross-chain APIs from the industry is also a possibility, moving towards interoperability between Hyperledger projects and industry solutions.

                ### Primary Focus

Coding

### Description

Since many newcomers to the technology are learning how to get started, and frequently ask questions on the Bevel Discord channel about deploying a blockchain network, primarily in a local environment, I believe it would be valuable to create a mentoring program. This program would help these individuals understand how to leverage the power of Hyperledger Bevel to deploy a private blockchain network with the DLT platform of choice on their Kubernetes cluster.

### Learning Objectives

- Deploy the DLT Network of choice on a Kubernetes Cluster using Hyperledger Bevel
- Deeper understanding of the DLT Platform of choice
- Learning Kubernetes.
- Deployment tools such as Ansible or Kubernetes manager like Helm
- Secrets storing tools used by Bevel

### Expected Outcome and Deliverables

- More contributors to Hyperledger Bevel, who could potentially become maintainers over time. This will help us keep our source code up to date, follow best development practices, and maintain well-prepared documentation that is easy to understand and follow. It will also encourage people who use Bevel to create new issues/features so the project continues to evolve.
- The project could see increased adoption for enterprise blockchain implementations.
- Greater involvement in Decentralized Trust projects in general, as Bevel utilizes other Decentralized Trust projects for DLT network deployments.

### Relation to LF Decentralized Trust and impact on the community

Since Hyperledger Bevel automates the deployment of many DLT platforms that are part of the LF Decentralized Trust ecosystem (we support Hyperledger Besu, Fabric, Indy, among others), it indirectly generates interest among mentees in these important projects within the ecosystem. In this way, we also attract new contributors to these projects.

### Recommended Skills

Understanding of what is Blockchain, and knowledge of Blockchain concepts such as a genesis file, nodes, smart contracts.
Kubernetes and Helm knowledge
Interaction with a terminal

Coding

### Description

Hyperledger Fabric has historically relied on crash fault-tolerant (CFT) consensus protocols like Raft and Kafka, which do not address Byzantine failures. To enhance Fabric’s security and resilience, this project aims to integrate BDLS, a scalable Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol, providing robust fault tolerance in adversarial environments.

The effort involves completing the BDLS implementation within Fabric’s ordering service, ensuring seamless compatibility with Fabric’s architecture, optimizing performance, and validating its advantages over existing solutions like SmartBFT.

### Description

The Trust over IP (ToIP) project has developed a new trust architecture centered around the Trust Spanning Protocol (TSP). TSP is an interoperability layer for highly assured trust relationships between endpoints in a similar way like IP is for connectivity.  Many trust tasks (or reusable patterns for trusted exchanges) can be developed in a modular fashion and with minimal development cost. In this project, prospective interns can develop 1 or 2 of such trust tasks using one of the supported languages (Rust (first preference), or Typescript, Python, Go, or C) and produces pre-specification documentation of the methods. There are a long list of tasks to choose from, for example: authentic time services, authentic location services, messaging services, TRQP over TSP, credential exchange (multiple variations) over TSP, additional DID methods. We can also factor in the candidate intern's research or career interests in selecting such trust tasks to develop. 

### Learning Objectives

- Learning about theories of trust and trust frameworks
- Learning about decentralized trust and decentralized identifiers (DID)
- Leaning programming of communication protocols
- Asynchronous messaging
- Highly distributed systems

### Expected Outcome and Deliverables

- A draft design document of how the trust task is to be implemented. Interns interested in protocol specification development may continue to make the document into a form of draft specifications. 1 or 2+ trust tasks.
- An experimental implementation of the selected trust tasks, 1 or 2+ trust tasks.

### Relation to LF Decentralized Trust and impact on the community

- Trust tasks development is a priority of the Trust over IP project's TSP Task Force.
- Trust tasks like those listed in examples are common usable applications to many decentralized systems, so their applicability can be beyond the ToIP project, e.g. Aries and Open Wallets.
- Many communities outside of LFDT, e.g. identity, verifiable credentials, decentralized social media, web3, just to name a few.

### Recommended Skills

- Clear reasoning and analytical or mathematical thinking skills.
- College level mathematic training, programming can be self-taught
- FIrst preference of programming language is Rust, but can also be Typescript, Python, Go, C etc.
- Familiar with Internet communication protocols

Research

### Description

**Project scope and overall Objective**: Utilizing LFDT platforms and tools , produce a technical architecture as a template for the software development of a Digital Twin for supply chains to track and model greenhouse gas(GHG) emissions for the eventual reduction to net-zero emissions.

**Background**: Recently, global governments have imposed legislation focused on requiring business entities to perform greenhouse gas (GHG) emission accounting in their supply chains as a requirement for trade. In addition, governments are pushing supply chains to become net-zero for GHG emissions. Other climate change related legislation impacting global supply chain GHG emission accounting and reduction are: 
•	Governments are attaching GHG emissions accounting regulations on supply chains importing goods into their countries.
•	Consumers and corporate customers are demanding sustainability in their business practices focused on GHG reduction.
•	The cost of GHG emissions is projected to increase substantially as governments implement net-zero GHG emission policies.
Many global 500 companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have declared their supply chains are to be net-zero GHG emitters by a described date. However, at the time of this writing their approach to accomplishing this task has yet to be defined.  

We believe meeting these ever more stringent GHG emission regulations is for supply chains to deploy Digital Twin(s) composed of LFDT blockchain technologies. The Digital Twin is to identically represent the physical supply chain with the ability to track the supply chain’s GHG emissions in real time. As important, if not more so, the Digital Twin will also serve as an important tool to model changes to the supply chain to provide options for reducing GHG emissions or to ultimately achieve a net-zero footprint.


### Learning Objectives

Mentee will learn/develop the following experiences:
- Gain the valuable and marketable experience and skill as an IT systems architect. Experience toward enterprise architecture certification.
- Learn the process of transitioning a **reference architecture** into a **technical architecture** which serves as a blueprint for the software coding/development of the software solution using **open source software.*. 
- Gain experience in the use of LFDT open source software to construct technical architectures that serve as the software for computer application construction.
- The mentee will learn the impact on project plans during the process of developing a technical architecture where modifications, additions, or component additions to the architecture are realized.
- Will experience at a technical level the advantages when using open source software(LFDT) in terms of project speed, architecture flexibility, and technical stability.


### Expected Outcome and Deliverables

- A revised reference architecture serving as the high level basis of the technical architecture.
- A detailed technical architecture describing the key components, technical stack, security and compliance, scalability, and performance of the application-system.
- Architecture diagrams and specific workflow designs (e.g., GHG emission data validation flow, tokenization process).
- Technical architecture documents that include a high level user guide. 

### Relation to LF Decentralized Trust and impact on the community

Project is related to Fabric, Besu, Iroha, Indy, and Aries. 
**Please note:** As the technical architecture for the software application is produced there is a high probability LFDT projects/Labs will be added/removed during project progression. 

With no standard procedure within global industry on the construction of a digital twin, LFDT open source software is to be promoted as the premier solution for the tracking and modeling of supply chain GHG emissions using a Digital Twin highlighting its real-time capabilities. Clear communication of the technical  architecture and digital twin concepts is essential. Additionally, all LFDT components necessary for building a supply chain digital twin should be defined, along with a demonstration of the LFDT Standards Working Group data ontology to ensure consistency and effectiveness.

### Recommended Skills

- Software development experience.
- Software systems design at a technical level.
- Understanding blockchain technologies.
- Understand or ability to learn LFDT open source software labs.
