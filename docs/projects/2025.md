                ### Primary Focus

Research

### Description

**Project scope and overall Objective**: Utilizing LFDT platforms and tools , produce a technical architecture as a template for the software development of a Digital Twin for supply chains to track and model greenhouse gas(GHG) emissions for the eventual reduction to net-zero emissions.

**Background**: Recently, global governments have imposed legislation focused on requiring business entities to perform greenhouse gas (GHG) emission accounting in their supply chains as a requirement for trade. In addition, governments are pushing supply chains to become net-zero for GHG emissions. Other climate change related legislation impacting global supply chain GHG emission accounting and reduction are: 
•	Governments are attaching GHG emissions accounting regulations on supply chains importing goods into their countries.
•	Consumers and corporate customers are demanding sustainability in their business practices focused on GHG reduction.
•	The cost of GHG emissions is projected to increase substantially as governments implement net-zero GHG emission policies.
Many global 500 companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have declared their supply chains are to be net-zero GHG emitters by a described date. However, at the time of this writing their approach to accomplishing this task has yet to be defined.  

We believe meeting these ever more stringent GHG emission regulations is for supply chains to deploy Digital Twin(s) composed of LFDT blockchain technologies. The Digital Twin is to identically represent the physical supply chain with the ability to track the supply chain’s GHG emissions in real time. As important, if not more so, the Digital Twin will also serve as an important tool to model changes to the supply chain to provide options for reducing GHG emissions or to ultimately achieve a net-zero footprint.


### Learning Objectives

Mentee will learn/develop the following experiences:
- Gain the valuable and marketable experience and skill as an IT systems architect. Experience toward enterprise architecture certification.
- Learn the process of transitioning a **reference architecture** into a **technical architecture** which serves as a blueprint for the software coding/development of the software solution using **open source software.*. 
- Gain experience in the use of LFDT open source software to construct technical architectures that serve as the software for computer application construction.
- The mentee will learn the impact on project plans during the process of developing a technical architecture where modifications, additions, or component additions to the architecture are realized.
- Will experience at a technical level the advantages when using open source software(LFDT) in terms of project speed, architecture flexibility, and technical stability.


### Expected Outcome and Deliverables

- A revised reference architecture serving as the high level basis of the technical architecture.
- A detailed technical architecture describing the key components, technical stack, security and compliance, scalability, and performance of the application-system.
- Architecture diagrams and specific workflow designs (e.g., GHG emission data validation flow, tokenization process).
- Technical architecture documents that include a high level user guide. 

### Relation to LF Decentralized Trust and impact on the community

Project is related to Fabric, Besu, Iroha, Indy, and Aries. 
**Please note:** As the technical architecture for the software application is produced there is a high probability LFDT projects/Labs will be added/removed during project progression. 

With no standard procedure within global industry on the construction of a digital twin, LFDT open source software is to be promoted as the premier solution for the tracking and modeling of supply chain GHG emissions using a Digital Twin highlighting its real-time capabilities. Clear communication of the technical  architecture and digital twin concepts is essential. Additionally, all LFDT components necessary for building a supply chain digital twin should be defined, along with a demonstration of the LFDT Standards Working Group data ontology to ensure consistency and effectiveness.

### Recommended Skills

- Software development experience.
- Software systems design at a technical level.
- Understanding blockchain technologies.
- Understand or ability to learn LFDT open source software labs.
