                ### Primary Focus

Coding

### Description

The Trust over IP (ToIP) project has developed a new trust architecture centered around the Trust Spanning Protocol (TSP). TSP is an interoperability layer for highly assured trust relationships between endpoints in a similar way like IP is for connectivity.  Many trust tasks (or reusable patterns for trusted exchanges) can be developed in a modular fashion and with minimal development cost. In this project, prospective interns can develop 1 or 2 of such trust tasks using one of the supported languages (Rust (first preference), or Typescript, Python, Go, or C) and produces pre-specification documentation of the methods. There are a long list of tasks to choose from, for example: authentic time services, authentic location services, messaging services, TRQP over TSP, credential exchange (multiple variations) over TSP, additional DID methods. We can also factor in the candidate intern's research or career interests in selecting such trust tasks to develop. 

### Learning Objectives

- Learning about theories of trust and trust frameworks
- Learning about decentralized trust and decentralized identifiers (DID)
- Leaning programming of communication protocols
- Asynchronous messaging
- Highly distributed systems

### Expected Outcome and Deliverables

- A draft design document of how the trust task is to be implemented. Interns interested in protocol specification development may continue to make the document into a form of draft specifications. 1 or 2+ trust tasks.
- An experimental implementation of the selected trust tasks, 1 or 2+ trust tasks.

### Relation to LF Decentralized Trust and impact on the community

- Trust tasks development is a priority of the Trust over IP project's TSP Task Force.
- Trust tasks like those listed in examples are common usable applications to many decentralized systems, so their applicability can be beyond the ToIP project, e.g. Aries and Open Wallets.
- Many communities outside of LFDT, e.g. identity, verifiable credentials, decentralized social media, web3, just to name a few.

### Recommended Skills

- Clear reasoning and analytical or mathematical thinking skills.
- College level mathematic training, programming can be self-taught
- FIrst preference of programming language is Rust, but can also be Typescript, Python, Go, C etc.
- Familiar with Internet communication protocols
