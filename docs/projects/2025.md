Hyperledger Solang is a Solidity to WASM/eBPF compiler written in Rust. Solang currently supports Solana, Polkadot and Stellar.
Currently, efforts are focused on the relatively new target `Soroban/Stellar`: https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build.
The goal of this mentorship is to contribute to this effort through optimizations of current implementations and adding new functionality to the compilation pipeline.

##[Help Beginners Deploy A DLT Platform Using Hyperledger Bevel](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-Mentorships/mentorship-program/issues/28)

Since many newcomers to the technology are learning how to get started, and frequently ask questions on the Bevel Discord channel about deploying a blockchain network, primarily in a local environment, I believe it would be valuable to create a mentoring program. This program would help these individuals understand how to leverage the power of Hyperledger Bevel to deploy a private blockchain network with the DLT platform of choice on their Kubernetes cluster.

##[BiniBFT - Integration with Fabric](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-Mentorships/mentorship-program/issues/26)

"BiniBFT - Integration with Fabric" aims to implement and integrate BiniBFT consensus  with Hyperledger Fabric. This is the Phase 3 of BiniBFT project from [BiniWorld Innovations](www.biniworld.com): Phase 1 was done as pilot [CLP](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CLP/pages/20283476/BiniBFT+-+An+Optimized+BFT+on+Fabric) project, and the basic design is developed in 2023; Phase 2 carried out as [MP](https://lf-hyperledger.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/INTERN/pages/21954996/BiniBFT+Implementation+-+The+Optimized+BFT+on+Fabric) in 2024 and significant architectural changes incorporated, and the pseudocode developed. By this project, we will be able to develop a pluggable consensus for enterprise blockchain, especially for Fabric with high scalability, throughput, without compromising the security.  

##[AFA, Decentralized Digital Signature for Image Tracking and Ownership Protection](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-Mentorships/mentorship-program/issues/24)

This project aims to create a decentralized platform that embeds a unique digital signature into uploaded images. This signature enables real-time tracking of the image’s online presence across various platforms. The goal is to empower content creators with full ownership and control over their visual assets.

The problem this project solves is unauthorized image distribution, which leads to copyright infringement and privacy violations. By leveraging decentralized trust technologies, this platform will ensure that:

Every uploaded image is uniquely signed.

The signature allows tracking where the image appears online.

Owners can request deletion of unauthorized copies.

##[Hyperledger Cello: Automated Testing and Version Upgrade](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-Mentorships/mentorship-program/issues/22)

Hyperledger Cello aims to simplify the deployment and management of blockchain technology across various industries, providing a powerful toolkit for on-demand creation, management, and monitoring of blockchain networks. This project involves comprehensive testing of the Cello backend API and upgrading Hyperledger Fabric to v3.0 to support the SmartBFT consensus. These enhancements will improve Cello’s maintainability and scalability, offering enterprise users a more robust Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) solution.

##[BDLS Integration into Hyperledger Fabric](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-Mentorships/mentorship-program/issues/22)

[<span style="background-color:rgb(221, 44, 121); color:white">2025-LF-Decentralized-Trust</span>](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-Mentorships/mentorship-program/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A2025-LF-Decentralized-Trust)

Hyperledger Fabric has historically relied on crash fault-tolerant (CFT) consensus protocols like Raft and Kafka, which do not address Byzantine failures. To enhance Fabric’s security and resilience, this project aims to integrate BDLS, a scalable Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol, providing robust fault tolerance in adversarial environments.

The effort involves completing the BDLS implementation within Fabric’s ordering service, ensuring seamless compatibility with Fabric’s architecture, optimizing performance, and validating its advantages over existing solutions like SmartBFT. Key tasks include refining the protocol’s leader election, message handling, and commit phases to align with Fabric’s modular consensus framework.

The implementation path involves extending Fabric’s ordering service API, optimizing cryptographic operations, and conducting rigorous benchmarking in distributed environments. The expected outcome is a fully integrated and production-ready BDLS consensus for Hyperledger Fabric, enabling enterprises to leverage scalable BFT consensus for mission-critical applications.

##[Designing and implementing trust tasks](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-Mentorships/mentorship-program/issues/16)

The Trust over IP (ToIP) project has developed a new trust architecture centered around the Trust Spanning Protocol (TSP). TSP is an interoperability layer for highly assured trust relationships between endpoints in a similar way like IP is for connectivity.  Many trust tasks (or reusable patterns for trusted exchanges) can be developed in a modular fashion and with minimal development cost. In this project, prospective interns can develop 1 or 2 of such trust tasks using one of the supported languages (Rust (first preference), or Typescript, Python, Go, or C) and produces pre-specification documentation of the methods. There are a long list of tasks to choose from, for example: authentic time services, authentic location services, messaging services, TRQP over TSP, credential exchange (multiple variations) over TSP, additional DID methods. We can also factor in the candidate intern's research or career interests in selecting such trust tasks to develop.
