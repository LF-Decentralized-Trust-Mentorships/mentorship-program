The CREDEBL Platform provides a set of scalable services to manage decentralized identity and verifiable credentials (VC) systems. It enables developers to build Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) solutions that offer enhanced privacy and security. Designed for scalability, CREDEBL supports population-scale SSI implementations while maintaining flexibility and interoperability with multiple ledger options such as Indy and Polygon, as well as ledger-less credential issuance using methods like did:web, did:key, and did:peer.

This mentorship project aims to enhance the platform’s test coverage by implementing end-to-end (E2E) tests as the primary objective and unit test cases as a secondary priority. The current lack of comprehensive testing exposes the platform to potential regressions, reducing reliability and maintainability. Through this effort, we aim to improve software quality, ensure API stability, and provide developers with a more robust foundation for future enhancements.

##[Extensible Library of DLT Connectors for Cacti](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-Mentorships/mentorship-program/issues/49)
[<span style="background-color:rgb(221, 44, 121); color:white">2025-LF-Decentralized-Trust</span>](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-Mentorships/mentorship-program/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A2025-LF-Decentralized-Trust)

[<span style="background-color:rgb(191, 212, 242); color:white">TAC Review</span>](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-Mentorships/mentorship-program/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22TAC%20Review%22)

Cacti provides modules and protocols for networks built on distributed ledgers to interoperate and run transactions spanning their boundaries, like asset transfers, asset swaps, and ledger data communication. Among these modules are DLT-specific "connectors", which provide the ability to send a limited set of ledger state queries and transaction requests to networks built on DLTs. But Cacti connectors have been developed ad hoc, because each DLT is built on a different application stack with a different SDK, and also because contributors have developed connectors without being guided by a unified vision. Also, Cacti is composed of two pre-existing systems, Cactus and Weaver, each bringing its own set of connectors (called "drivers" in Weaver) with redundant as well as complementary features.

In this project, we will create an extensible library of pluggable connectors that can be be selected and deployed based on DLT type. We will design a common development template and gRPC-based client API for connectors by inspecting existing connector implementations. Connecters will support the vendor-neutral IETF SATP standard and trigger ledger operations through the Common Operators Module (COPM). We will also integrate Cactus and Weaver further according to the Cacti architecture by merging Cactus connectors and Weaver drivers for Fabric and Corda into canonical Cacti connectors for those two DLTs.

##[Blockchain-Based OAuth 2.0 Authorization in 5G Core Networks with Hyperledger Fabric](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-Mentorships/mentorship-program/issues/48)
[<span style="background-color:rgb(221, 44, 121); color:white">2025-LF-Decentralized-Trust</span>](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-Mentorships/mentorship-program/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A2025-LF-Decentralized-Trust)

The convergence of blockchain and 5G security presents an opportunity to redefine authentication mechanisms within the core network. Traditional OAuth 2.0 authorization mechanisms in 5G rely on centralized components such as the Network Repository Function (NRF) to verify NF identities and issue access tokens. This introduces risks, including single points of failure, insider threats, and identity spoofing.

##[Scalable and Privacy-Preserving Decentralized Identity on Layer 2 Rollups](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-Mentorships/mentorship-program/issues/47)
[<span style="background-color:rgb(221, 44, 121); color:white">2025-LF-Decentralized-Trust</span>](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-Mentorships/mentorship-program/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A2025-LF-Decentralized-Trust)

This project aims to integrate Hyperledger Aries, Indy, and AnonCreds with Layer 2 (L2) rollups (e.g., zkSync) to create a scalable, cost-efficient, and privacy-preserving decentralized identity (DID) system. This project will offload the most expensive part of identity verification—zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) generation and verification in AnonCreds— to L2, reducing the computational and gas costs of verifiable credential (VC) issuance and authentication. By using L2 rollups for credential commitments, revocation registries, and consent management, the project ensures fast, low-cost transactions while periodically anchoring state proofs to Ethereum (L1) for auditability and trust. This system will enable decentralized authentication for dApps, and Web3 platforms without relying on centralized identity providers.

Blockchain technology, originally developed for TCP/IP-based networks, has emerged as a transformative force across various industries, attributable to its decentralized, immutable, and highly secure ledger capabilities. Nevertheless, the advent of new applications in non-TCP/IP environments, such as satellite links, mesh networks, and IoT protocols (e.g. LoRaWAN), necessitate tailored adaptations to facilitate the effective integration of blockchain. This proposal presents a testing framework aimed at assessing blockchain performance in these non-TCP/IP contexts, with a particular emphasis on its application in satellite communication.

Fablo is a tool mostly used for local development and in CI. It starts a Hyperledger Fabric network from a single configuration file, and supports various features that makes the development easier (REST API, network snapshots, advanced topology configuration, hooks, etc). It supports Hyperledger Fabric in versions 2.x and 3.x.

We need to ensure that all features that are supported for Fabric v2 are also supported for v3, which esp. involves peer dev mode, network snapshots, and channel query scripts.

Mentee is going to work with our test suites in Bash scripts and Jest tests, improving the coverage, potential gaps in the documentation, and resolving potential issues that will be detected. We expect the majority of work will consist of writing and improving our tests.

This project aims to create a decentralized platform that embeds a unique digital signature into uploaded images. This signature enables real-time tracking of the image’s online presence across various platforms. The goal is to empower content creators with full ownership and control over their visual assets.

The problem this project solves is unauthorized image distribution, which leads to copyright infringement and privacy violations. By leveraging decentralized trust technologies, this platform will ensure that:

Every uploaded image is uniquely signed.

The signature allows tracking where the image appears online.

Owners can request deletion of unauthorized copies.

Hyperledger Fabric has historically relied on crash fault-tolerant (CFT) consensus protocols like Raft and Kafka, which do not address Byzantine failures. To enhance Fabric’s security and resilience, this project aims to integrate BDLS, a scalable Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol, providing robust fault tolerance in adversarial environments.

The effort involves completing the BDLS implementation within Fabric’s ordering service, ensuring seamless compatibility with Fabric’s architecture, optimizing performance, and validating its advantages over existing solutions like SmartBFT. Key tasks include refining the protocol’s leader election, message handling, and commit phases to align with Fabric’s modular consensus framework.

The implementation path involves extending Fabric’s ordering service API, optimizing cryptographic operations, and conducting rigorous benchmarking in distributed environments. The expected outcome is a fully integrated and production-ready BDLS consensus for Hyperledger Fabric, enabling enterprises to leverage scalable BFT consensus for mission-critical applications.

The Trust over IP (ToIP) project has developed a new trust architecture centered around the Trust Spanning Protocol (TSP). TSP is an interoperability layer for highly assured trust relationships between endpoints in a similar way like IP is for connectivity.  Many trust tasks (or reusable patterns for trusted exchanges) can be developed in a modular fashion and with minimal development cost. In this project, prospective interns can develop 1 or 2 of such trust tasks using one of the supported languages (Rust (first preference), or Typescript, Python, Go, or C) and produces pre-specification documentation of the methods. There are a long list of tasks to choose from, for example: authentic time services, authentic location services, messaging services, TRQP over TSP, credential exchange (multiple variations) over TSP, additional DID methods. We can also factor in the candidate intern's research or career interests in selecting such trust tasks to develop.
