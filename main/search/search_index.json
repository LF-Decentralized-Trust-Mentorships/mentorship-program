The effort involves completing the BDLS implementation within Fabric\u2019s ordering service, ensuring seamless compatibility with Fabric\u2019s architecture, optimizing performance, and validating its advantages over existing solutions like SmartBFT. Key tasks include refining the protocol\u2019s leader election, message handling, and commit phases to align with Fabric\u2019s modular consensus framework.  The implementation path involves extending Fabric\u2019s ordering service API, optimizing cryptographic operations, and conducting rigorous benchmarking in distributed environments. The expected outcome is a fully integrated and production-ready BDLS consensus for Hyperledger Fabric, enabling enterprises to leverage scalable BFT consensus for mission-critical applications.    ### **Learning Objectives**    - **Understanding BFT Consensus in Hyperledger Fabric** \u2013 Gain in-depth knowledge of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) and its role in blockchain consensus, comparing BDLS with existing protocols like Raft and SmartBFT.    - **Hands-on Development with Hyperledger Fabric** \u2013 Learn how to extend Fabric\u2019s ordering service by implementing and optimizing BDLS, modifying consensus APIs, and integrating cryptographic components.    - **Performance Benchmarking and Optimization** \u2013 Develop skills in designing and executing large-scale performance tests, analyzing transaction throughput (TPS), and optimizing system efficiency for real-world deployments.    - **Open Source Contribution &amp; Collaboration** \u2013 Gain experience contributing to a high-impact open-source project, collaborating with maintainers, and following best practices for issue tracking, code reviews, and documentation.    - **Scalability and Security Considerations** \u2013 Understand the trade-offs in blockchain consensus design, learning how to balance security, scalability, and performance in decentralized networks.     ### **Expected Outcome and Deliverables**    - **Full BDLS Consensus Integration in Hyperledger Fabric** \u2013 Complete implementation of BDLS as a pluggable ordering service, supporting both normal and configuration blocks for adding/removing nodes dynamically.    - **Test Network Deployment and Validation** \u2013 A functional Hyperledger Fabric test network running BDLS, demonstrating its stability, fault tolerance, and performance in real-world scenarios.    - **Performance Benchmarking Report** \u2013 A comprehensive evaluation comparing BDLS with Raft and SmartBFT, highlighting transaction throughput (TPS), scalability, and latency under different workloads.    - **Comprehensive Documentation and Tutorials** \u2013 Clear technical documentation covering BDLS integration, configuration, and deployment in Fabric, along with a step-by-step guide for developers.    - **Open-Source Contribution and Community Engagement** \u2013 Code contributions merged into the Hyperledger Fabric repository (or a fork), along with active participation in Fabric\u2019s developer community through discussions and issue tracking.      ### Relation to LF Decentralized Trust and impact on the community  Hyperledger Fabric   ### **Recommended Skills**    - **Blockchain and Hyperledger Fabric** \u2013 Understanding of blockchain architecture, Hyperledger Fabric components, and experience with Fabric\u2019s ordering service.    - **Consensus Protocols &amp; Distributed Systems** \u2013 Knowledge of Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms, especially BDLS, Raft, and SmartBFT, and their impact on performance and security.    - **Golang Development** \u2013 Proficiency in Go programming, as Hyperledger Fabric and its ordering service are primarily implemented in Go.    - **Cryptographic Principles** \u2013 Familiarity with cryptographic signatures, message authentication, and security best practices in distributed networks.    - **Docker &amp; Kubernetes** \u2013 Experience with containerization, running blockchain networks in Docker, and managing deployments with Kubernetes.    - **Performance Testing &amp; Benchmarking** \u2013 Ability to design and execute large-scale performance tests, analyze transaction throughput (TPS), and optimize system efficiency.    - **Git &amp; Open Source Contribution** \u2013 Experience with Git, version control, issue tracking, and contributing to open-source projects following best practices.     ### Mentor(s) Names and Contact Info  Dr. Ahmed Al Salih a.alsalih2@gmail.com Chat ID: ahmedalsalih#6158  ### Additional Information  Since the last mentorship program, I have published research papers including incredible results regarding the outcome of the project with enhancing the throughput TPS: * https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10718288 * Also an active lab within the hyperledger-labs already exist :https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/bdls                       Created At 2025-02-28 18:37:51 +0000 UTC                       Issue 16                      Designing and implementing trust tasks                  Coding2025-LF-Decentralized-TrustTAC Review                  ### Primary Focus  Coding  ### Description  The Trust over IP (ToIP) project has developed a new trust architecture centered around the Trust Spanning Protocol (TSP). TSP is an interoperability layer for highly assured trust relationships between endpoints in a similar way like IP is for connectivity.  Many trust tasks (or reusable patterns for trusted exchanges) can be developed in a modular fashion and with minimal development cost. In this project, prospective interns can develop 1 or 2 of such trust tasks using one of the supported languages (Rust (first preference), or Typescript, Python, Go, or C) and produces pre-specification documentation of the methods. There are a long list of tasks to choose from, for example: authentic time services, authentic location services, messaging services, TRQP over TSP, credential exchange (multiple variations) over TSP, additional DID methods. We can also factor in the candidate intern's research or career interests in selecting such trust tasks to develop.   ### Learning Objectives  - Learning about theories of trust and trust frameworks - Learning about decentralized trust and decentralized identifiers (DID) - Leaning programming of communication protocols - Asynchronous messaging - Highly distributed systems  ### Expected Outcome and Deliverables  - A draft design document of how the trust task is to be implemented. Interns interested in protocol specification development may continue to make the document into a form of draft specifications. 1 or 2+ trust tasks. - An experimental implementation of the selected trust tasks, 1 or 2+ trust tasks.  ### Relation to LF Decentralized Trust and impact on the community  - Trust tasks development is a priority of the Trust over IP project's TSP Task Force. - Trust tasks like those listed in examples are common usable applications to many decentralized systems, so their applicability can be beyond the ToIP project, e.g. Aries and Open Wallets. - Many communities outside of LFDT, e.g. identity, verifiable credentials, decentralized social media, web3, just to name a few.  ### Recommended Skills  - Clear reasoning and analytical or mathematical thinking skills. - College level mathematic training, programming can be self-taught - FIrst preference of programming language is Rust, but can also be Typescript, Python, Go, C etc. - Familiar with Internet communication protocols  ### Mentor(s) Names and Contact Info  Wenjing Chu and/or other TSP task force members @wenjing    ### Additional Information  Trust spanning protocol spec: https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-tsp-specification/ Trust spanning protocol code: https://github.com/openwallet-foundation-labs/tsp TSP task force wiki: https://lf-toip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HOME/pages/22999835/Trust+Spanning+Protocol+Task+Force                        Created At 2025-02-11 04:51:11 +0000 UTC                       Issue 14                      Using LFDT Blockchain Platforms Develop the Technical Architecture for the Development of a Digital Twin to Reduce Greenhouse Gas(GHG) Emissions from Supply Chains                  Research2025-LF-Decentralized-TrustTAC Review                  ### Primary Focus  Research  ### Description  **Project scope and overall Objective**: Utilizing LFDT platforms and tools , produce a technical architecture as a template for the software development of a Digital Twin for supply chains to track and model greenhouse gas(GHG) emissions for the eventual reduction to net-zero emissions.  **Background**: Recently, global governments have imposed legislation focused on requiring business entities to perform greenhouse gas (GHG) emission accounting in their supply chains as a requirement for trade. In addition, governments are pushing supply chains to become net-zero for GHG emissions. Other climate change related legislation impacting global supply chain GHG emission accounting and reduction are:  \u2022   Governments are attaching GHG emissions accounting regulations on supply chains importing goods into their countries. \u2022   Consumers and corporate customers are demanding sustainability in their business practices focused on GHG reduction. \u2022   The cost of GHG emissions is projected to increase substantially as governments implement net-zero GHG emission policies. Many global 500 companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have declared their supply chains are to be net-zero GHG emitters by a described date. However, at the time of this writing their approach to accomplishing this task has yet to be defined.    We believe meeting these ever more stringent GHG emission regulations is for supply chains to deploy Digital Twin(s) composed of LFDT blockchain technologies. The Digital Twin is to identically represent the physical supply chain with the ability to track the supply chain\u2019s GHG emissions in real time. As important, if not more so, the Digital Twin will also serve as an important tool to model changes to the supply chain to provide options for reducing GHG emissions or to ultimately achieve a net-zero footprint.   ### Learning Objectives  Mentee will learn/develop the following experiences: - Gain the valuable and marketable experience and skill as an IT systems architect. Experience toward enterprise architecture certification. - Learn the process of transitioning a **reference architecture** into a **technical architecture** which serves as a blueprint for the software coding/development of the software solution using **open source software.*.  - Gain experience in the use of LFDT open source software to construct technical architectures that serve as the software for computer application construction. - The mentee will learn the impact on project plans during the process of developing a technical architecture where modifications, additions, or component additions to the architecture are realized. - Will experience at a technical level the advantages when using open source software(LFDT) in terms of project speed, architecture flexibility, and technical stability.   ### Expected Outcome and Deliverables  - A revised reference architecture serving as the high level basis of the technical architecture. - A detailed technical architecture describing the key components, technical stack, security and compliance, scalability, and performance of the application-system. - Architecture diagrams and specific workflow designs (e.g., GHG emission data validation flow, tokenization process). - Technical architecture documents that include a high level user guide.   ### Relation to LF Decentralized Trust and impact on the community  Project is related to Fabric, Besu, Iroha, Indy, and Aries.  **Please note:** As the technical architecture for the software application is produced there is a high probability LFDT projects/Labs will be added/removed during project progression.   With no standard procedure within global industry on the construction of a digital twin, LFDT open source software is to be promoted as the premier solution for the tracking and modeling of supply chain GHG emissions using a Digital Twin highlighting its real-time capabilities. Clear communication of the technical  architecture and digital twin concepts is essential. Additionally, all LFDT components necessary for building a supply chain digital twin should be defined, along with a demonstration of the LFDT Standards Working Group data ontology to ensure consistency and effectiveness.  ### Recommended Skills  - Software development experience. - Software systems design at a technical level. - Understanding blockchain technologies. - Understand or ability to learn LFDT open source software labs.  ### Mentor(s) Names and Contact Info  Jeff Pribich ( jeff.pribich@gmail.com ) (Chair - LFDT Climate Action and Accounting Special Interest Group) (Chair - LFDT Supply Chain and Trade Finance Special Interest Group)  ### Additional Information  [Net Zero Digital Twin-In Process - Draft v2.0.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18722810/Net.Zero.Digital.Twin-In.Process.-.Draft.v2.0.pdf)  https://github.com/JSPApril/NZDT-Tech-Architecture                       Created At 2025-02-09 01:35:29 +0000 UTC"}]}
