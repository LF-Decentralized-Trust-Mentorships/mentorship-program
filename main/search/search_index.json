In addition, governments are pushing supply chains to become net-zero for GHG emissions. Other climate change related legislation impacting global supply chain GHG emission accounting and reduction are:  \u2022   Governments are attaching GHG emissions accounting regulations on supply chains importing goods into their countries. \u2022   Consumers and corporate customers are demanding sustainability in their business practices focused on GHG reduction. \u2022   The cost of GHG emissions is projected to increase substantially as governments implement net-zero GHG emission policies. Many global 500 companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have declared their supply chains are to be net-zero GHG emitters by a described date. However, at the time of this writing their approach to accomplishing this task has yet to be defined.  </p> <p>We believe meeting these ever more stringent GHG emission regulations is for supply chains to deploy Digital Twin(s) composed of LFDT blockchain technologies. The Digital Twin is to identically represent the physical supply chain with the ability to track the supply chain\u2019s GHG emissions in real time. As important, if not more so, the Digital Twin will also serve as an important tool to model changes to the supply chain to provide options for reducing GHG emissions or to ultimately achieve a net-zero footprint.</p>"},{"location":"projects/2025/#learning-objectives_6","title":"Learning Objectives","text":"<p>Mentee will learn/develop the following experiences: - Gain the valuable and marketable experience and skill as an IT systems architect.
