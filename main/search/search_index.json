But Cacti connectors have been developed ad hoc, because each DLT is built on a different application stack with a different SDK, and also because contributors have developed connectors without being guided by a unified vision. Also, Cacti is composed of two pre-existing systems, Cactus and Weaver, each bringing its own set of connectors (called \"drivers\" in Weaver) with redundant as well as complementary features.</p> <p>In this project, we will create an extensible library of pluggable connectors that can be be selected and deployed based on DLT type.

TSP is an interoperability layer for highly assured trust relationships between endpoints in a similar way like IP is for connectivity.  Many trust tasks (or reusable patterns for trusted exchanges) can be developed in a modular fashion and with minimal development cost. In this project, prospective interns can develop 1 or 2 of such trust tasks using one of the supported languages (Rust (first preference), or Typescript, Python, Go, or C) and produces pre-specification documentation of the methods. There are a long list of tasks to choose from, for example: authentic time services, authentic location services, messaging services, TRQP over TSP, credential exchange (multiple variations) over TSP, additional DID methods. We can also factor in the candidate intern's research or career interests in selecting such trust tasks to develop. </p>"},{"location":"projects/2025/#using-lfdt-blockchain-platforms-develop-the-technical-architecture-for-the-development-of-a-digital-twin-to-reduce-greenhouse-gasghg-emissions-from-supply-chains","title":"Using LFDT Blockchain Platforms Develop the Technical Architecture for the Development of a Digital Twin to Reduce Greenhouse Gas(GHG) Emissions from Supply Chains","text":"<p>2025-LF-Decentralized-Trust Research TAC Review</p> <p>Utilizing LFDT platforms and tools , produce a technical architecture as a template for the software development of a Digital Twin for supply chains to track and model greenhouse gas(GHG) emissions for the eventual reduction to net-zero emissions.</p>"}]}
